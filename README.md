# Special Thanks
1. We are thankful to authors of Jurassic (we have incorporated number parser, promise and some unit tests from Jurassic.) https://github.com/paulbartrum/jurassic
2. We are thankful to authors of EsprimaDotNet, we initially built prototype over EsprimaDotNet, but we chose to build our parser/scanner from scratch to support token spans. https://github.com/sebastienros/esprima-dotnet
3. We are thankful to author of ILPack (we have incorporated saving IL to Assembly from this library.) https://github.com/Lokad/ILPack

# Features
1. Compiles JavaScript to .Net Assembly 
2. Strict Mode Only JavaScript*
3. Module support
4. Null coalesce
5. Rest Parameters
6. Generators
7. Async/Await
8. Optional parameters
9. Many ES5 + ES6 features
10. CommonJS Module Support
11. CSX Module support

* Most JavaScript today is available in strict mode, we do not feel any need to support non strict mode as modules are strict by default.

# CSX Module Support

YantraJS can load JavaScript module as well as CSX Module (with specific format). YantraJS will load CSX instead of JavaScript for the same named file, this way you can create CSX module and it's node compatible companion module that will run correctly in node environment.

## CSX Module Delegate Export

```c#
#r "nuget: YantraJS.Core,1.0.18"
using System;
using System.Linq;
using YantraJS.Core;
using YantraJS.Core.Clr;

static void Module(JSValue exports, JSValue require, JSValue module, string __filename, string __dirname) {
    
    var importedModule = require.Call(new JSString("other-module"));
    var importedFun = importedModule["namedImport"]

    // named export
    exports["namedExport"] = JSNumber.Zero;

    // export *
    module["exports"] = new JSFunction((in Arguments a) => {
        // do something here...
        // a.This is `this`
        return JSUndefined.Value;
    }, "Function Description");
}

return (JSModuleDelegate)Module;
```


## CSX Module Export Type

Exporting C# Type as module is easier compared to Module delegate, but you cannot import other modules in it.

```c#
#r "nuget: YantraJS.Core,1.0.18"
using System;
using System.Linq;
using YantraJS.Core;
using YantraJS.Core.Clr;


// Export attribute with parameter is considered as `*`
[Export]
// Named Export
[Export("url")]
// Default export
[DefaultExport]
public class JSUrl {

    private Uri uri;

    public JSUrl(in Arguments a) {
        this.uri = new Uri(a.Get1().ToString());
    }

    public string Host => uri.Host;

}
```

# Usage

## Synchronous JavaScript

```c#
var context = new JSContext();

// create global function
context["add"] = new JSFunction((in Arguments a) => {
    return new JSNumber(
         (a[0]?.IntValue ?? 0) + (a[1]?.IntValue ?? 0)
    );
});

var result = context.FastEval("add(4,5)", "script.js");
```

## Asynchronous JavaScript

There are two ways to execute asynchronous javascript code. First one is to use `FastEval` and convert it to Task and await on it.

```c#
var context = new JSContext();

var r = context.FastEval("some async code", "script.js");

var result = await (r is JSPromise promise).Task;
```

Second method is to call `Eval` which will create it's own SynchronizationContext and wait for the result.


```c#
var context = new JSContext();

var result = context.Eval("some async code", "script.js");
```
## Marshal

To convert any clr object to JSValue, you can use `ClrProxy.Marshal()` method, which will wrap object in `JSValue` wrapper and you will be able to call C# methods inside JavaScript with camel case.

### Argument conversion

Clr type exported to JavaScript will first find if method with a single parameter with `Arguments` struct with `in` modifier is present. If it has, it will call this method directly without any translation.

Otherwise, YantraJS will try to find best possible match after calling `ConvertTo` on each of arguments, this may be slow if there are many methods with same name.

Ideally, a single method and single constructor would be the best candidate to write CSX module.

# Scope

ES standard is very vast and conforming every specification is currently out of scope. Our aim is to create workable JavaScript engine that supports most used features.


# Design

1. Scanner and Parser are written in C# from scratch.
2. YantraJS.Core uses generated AST to generate ILExpression tree. ILExpression tree is easy to visualize and one node represents one type of generated IL code.
3. ILExpressions can be compiled to IL and can also be saved to an assembly for caching.
4. User can evaluate context.current function to find current stack trace in JavaScript environment
5. Majority of code is written as virtual method of JSValue derived object to reduce the amount of code to be generated.
6. Even though JIT inlining will run faster, but setting up JIT takes longer and to improve loading time, we prefer longer method instead of calling multiple smaller methods.
7. Generators are implemented as simple jumps, they run in the same thread.
8. Async/Await are generated over generators.

# No support for primitive types
This decision was taken based on following observation
1. Every method call will require reference type in order to support JavaScript's advanced types.
2. Generating code based on primitive type will anyway create a reference as every value will be sent in as `object`.
3. So having JSNumber value holding a value as double is of exactly same cost as using double and passing it on as object.
4. Supporting primitive type will also make code generation very complex as too much of condition checks will make further enhancement difficult.

# Roadmap
1. Add V8 Debugging protocol
6. Few node in-built modules, fs, process, net etc...
7. Align ES conformance, many of the methods are not 100% compatible with ES6 standard.

# Low Priority Roadmap
1. Support Date for larger years than -9999 to 9999 years. This will require rewriting JSDate with some date type other than DateTime that supports larger range.

# So how to generate faster code?
No we do not want to generate faster code, everything runs in CLR, CLR supports primitive types and you can always write high performance C# code and call it from JavaScript.

We can import CSX modules, which can be compiled natively to give higher performance. CSX Modules have higher priority, so if you are creating a package that can run on node as well as yantra, you can ship CSX to give higher performance over same javascript on node.

# Design choice to generate code

1. AST is transformed into ILExpression tree, which is simple form of IL to be generated.

 ### Complexity
 1. Tail Call Optimization is done by JIT so we do not do any optimization.

 ## No System.Text.Json

 We are not going to use System.Text.Json because it is not available on .NET Frameworks. This library is designed to run on older platforms as well.

 ## Performance Points

 1. Do not use Switch pattern matching for types, 
 [Switch Pattern on SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgtghgzgLgpgJwDQxNMSAmIDUAfAAQCYBGAWACgCBmAAmNoGFaBvS2j29zm+gFloBZABQBKWgF4AfEJLCAdgFcANstEBubhy306BAYLkAlAPYmYtCOLYVOd2lADuASxgBjABbCrrHfc5u0HC0AIK0APokIH7+9owm8lAmynAAdADqCK5wwpGpAGYaMbGcwAhwEADWmrYlAUG0AEIRRNG1dXEJSSkZWfC5RAVF7R2l5VU1JQC+xUxdyWmZ2d6pAGLDdjMjOrz6QkTCpuaWojYlAG4QCLTAkrTCIaIQk7HxiQu9y8BDLxxbdrsDNRDmYLFYzq95j0lv0IGsNpwtltKLwIMBYAgIG4LAwjhYbDs6GiMViLM55BZVqxaABzOAwdS0JGUFFEUIgWh43ztXjkiz5O4kGqE2gmc6ILKYYJ82hU6S0fI1ZFUNmNDlciG6WgygUSWhEX5cEa8MUS5xS7UU2WSGSKyhTIA==)
 Based on above example, it seems every `is` operator is expensive as it makes first call to check if it is assignable from the given type. 
 It is not a simple call, it is series of calls to check if current type is same or current type is derived from assignable type.

 2. Virtual properties are useful. As casting also requires a `call` instruction.
 3. Struct initializations can be improved by using `ref Put()` instead of Assignment or Set with `in` operator

## Unit Testing

1. `assert()`, This function will test if given value is true (that is not empty, not zero, not null and not undefined).
2. `assert.strictEqual(left, right [,error])` checks if left is strictly equal to right, displays error if it does not match.
3. `assert.notStrictEqual(left, right [,error])` checks if left is not strictly equal to right, displays error if it matches.
4. `assert.throws(fn [, error] [, message])` executes given function and expects an error.
5. `assert.matches(left, regex, [, error])` checks if left matches right regex, displays error if it does not match.
6. `assert.doesNotMatch(left, regex, [, error])` checks if left matches right regex, displays error if it does not match.
